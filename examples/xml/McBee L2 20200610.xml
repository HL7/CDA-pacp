                        <paragraph>It is very important for you to discuss your medical treatment goals and wishes with
                        your healthcare agent, your family, and your medical care providers. Keep in mind
                        that advance medical directives are simply expressions of your medical treatment goals
                        and preferences. There is no guarantee that your medical care providers will follow all of
                        your wishes, but one thing is certain: If your advance medical directives cannot be
                        quickly located and retrieved in a time of need, then medical care providers, your
                        family and friends will not be able to take your wishes into consideration when they
                        make critical decisions regarding your treatment.</paragraph>

                                all life-sustaining treatments and let me die as gently as possible. I realize that I will not
                                receive life-sustaining treatments including but not limited to breathing machines, blood

                                that medical personnel will not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and they will
                                allow me to die naturally.

                                stop, and an attempt to resuscitate me would cause me significant suffering, OR it simply
                                will not work in my condition.
